engineering can be difficult to implement if the words and framework
are not clearly understood by all parties involved.  INCOSE has
adopted a definition of systems engineering; yet a debate continues
over what systems engineering is and how to do it.  The authors have
developed over a period of many years the FRAT framework for
describing the process used to implement systems engineering for any
task, the name for which is derived by the first letters letters of
the series of words function, requirement, answer, and test.  FRAT is
based on the hypothesis that four views of a system are needed to
completely define any system.  These views are what it does
(functions), how well the functions are performed (requirements), a
physical or actual description of the system (answers), and
verification and validation of the system when completed (tests). 
The FRAT framework has been validated by reviewing all the papers
published at INCOSE proceedings.  It is important to recognize that
the system of interest (a product) is produced by another system (a
production system).  Both of these systems can be described by the
four FRAT views when developing a shared vision of the development
process as well as the product being developed.</span></font></p>
