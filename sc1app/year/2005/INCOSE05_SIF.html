<p style="text-align: left;"><font size="3">An organizations ability to
effectively create, deploy and use system integration frameworks is a
discriminating technical capability which will continure to grow in
importance for the design, development and deployment of future
engineeried systems. &nbsp;Engineering activities utilized in
large-scale systems integration processes are strongly associated with
organized problem solving and complexity reduction. &nbsp;This paper
outlines the relationships between systems, meta-systems, and
integration frameworks as well as complexity measures, reduction and
management. &nbsp;The primary thesis of this paper relates to the
design and use of integration frameworks as a fundamental means of
complexity reduction. &nbsp;A system "abstraction frame" concept is
presented and related to classical systems engineering mathematics and
practices. &nbsp;A proposal for a systems engineering language
completes the content of this paper. &nbsp;A formal systems engineering
language will greatly reduce complexity in the practice of systems
engineering, as well as facilitate the solution of even more complex
problems.</font></p>
