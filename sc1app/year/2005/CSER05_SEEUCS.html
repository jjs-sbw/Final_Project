System</b></p>

<p class="p5"><b>Abstract: </b>Experience using UML for systems
engineering on a complex system is described.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The system was an
experimental situation awareness system for small military units such
as a hostage rescue mission. This experience provides insight into the
use of process- oriented and object-oriented models. Real projects that
experiment with methodology are an important source of information that
cannot be duplicated on a contrived problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p5">Most of the functional requirements in this system
involved software but there was also unique hardware. Use case
specifications were derived directly from a very high level
specification from the customer without any intervening artifact.
Subsystem interaction diagrams were developed from the use case
specifications. The use of UML as a systems design tool had the
advantage that it greatly facilitated the transition into software
development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p5">While this approach was largely successful, there were
some cases when the object-oriented model did not fit the problem. In
addition to their role in task automation, models provide a mental
representation that helps us solve engineering problems. Object-
oriented and process oriented models provide two different
representations. Because this project attempted to apply an
object-oriented model so broadly, it was a de facto experiment in the
use of such models. An examination of the cases where a
process-oriented model fit better than object-oriented model provides
insight into the differences between these two views.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The experience on this
project supports the idea that<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;
</span>each view is a better cognitive fit to a different set of
problems.</p>
