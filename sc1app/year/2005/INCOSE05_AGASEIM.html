<div style="text-align: left;"><big>Systems engineering tasks generate
large volumes of data and information that must be available over the
lifecycle of the system. &nbsp;This paper outlines an information model
designed to support existing systems engineering methods and practices
as well as newly developed techniques. &nbsp;Specific methods and
models used for the capture, encoding and persistence of systems
engineering information and design artifacts were given special
attention during the evaluation, analysis and model design phases.
&nbsp;A generic systems engineering meta-model was then developed and
used as a basis for the systems engineering information model that was
developed and presented in this work.<br>
