<p class="p1"><b>A Meeting of the Minds: A Successful Systems
Engineering Experiment using Concept Maps for Effective Communications</b></p>
<p class="p2">Presented at INCOSE 2005</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>Abstract: </b></span>An informal
experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of communicating
Systems Engineering concepts with customers using Concept Maps. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The goal was to
understand systems engineering concepts and techniques with customers
using non- technical diagrams, as well as to establish that the systems
engineers had more-accurately captured customer needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
</p>
<p class="p6">In short, the experiment was about creating a more
customer-friendly vehicle that enabled “Systems
Engineering-speak”.&nbsp; This paper describes the
customer/engineer communication problems found during the experiment,
compares the
effectiveness of Concept Maps and Use Cases for this experiment,
describes Concept Map basics
and the customer’s reaction to them, and describes the proposed Systems
Engineer’s use of
Concept Maps.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The
authors note that there are other, successful systems engineering
communication methodologies and endeavors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>They were not addressed
in this experiment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Never-the-less,
the result of the experiment was an
enthusiastic and successful meeting of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>minds, resulting in a
successful shared
customer/engineering vision. We offer our Concept Map findings for
serious consideration in establishing both customer-friendly and
Systems Engineer effective communications.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
