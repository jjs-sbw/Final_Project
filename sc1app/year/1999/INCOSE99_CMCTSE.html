any “deep learning” situation, and in communicating in
particular, understanding will be enhanced by using techniques that
more closely fit the nonlinear structure of our thinking processes. 
This idea is particularly relevant to systems engineering, which
deals with so many interrelated concepts – concepts whose parts are
often handled by separate organizations with different “languages”
and foci, presenting additional barriers and confusion in
understanding.  In the figures in this paper, we have tried to show a
variety of patterns that concept mapping can be cast in, for
flexibility and interest.  Our experience in Boeing is that such an
approach simplifies, deepens and clarifies communications, while
providing the opportunity to find ways to develop more complete and
integrated concepts.</span></font></p>
