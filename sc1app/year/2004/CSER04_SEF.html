activities associated with systems engineering are closely associated
with problem solving and complexity reduction.  Many claims are made
about the benefits of systems engineering, both for complexity
reduction and complexity management.  This paper will explore the
relationship between systems, meta-systems, complexity types,
complexity measures and complexity reduction.  The primary thesis of
this paper relates to systems engineering as a method to reduce
complexity.  A system “abstraction frame” concept is developed
and used as a device to support the analysis and measurement of
complexity associated with systems and systems engineering. 
Meta-systems concepts are explored for use as a mechanism to further
describe systems engineering activities and also as a basis for the
development of a systems definition framework. </span></font>
