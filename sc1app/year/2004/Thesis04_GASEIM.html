Systems engineering tasks are a central set of technical management tasks used by large
distributed groups of individuals to design, develop, produce, and operate large,
engineered systems. In this work, standard systems engineering methods and activities
are analyzed and evaluated in the context of current engineering practice. Specific
methods and models used for the capture, encoding and storage of systems engineering
information and artifacts are given special attention during the evaluation and analysis
phase. A generic systems engineering meta-model is then developed and used as a basis
for the systems engineering information models that are developed and presented in this
work.
        The generic systems engineering meta-model developed in this work is founded
on the scientific problem solving process. A unique process named CCFRAT (for the
Concept, Context, Function, Requirement, Architecture and Test views that are the core
system views used in this process) is developed in this work. The meta-model and
process are then used as a foundation for the standard relational data modeling activities
required to produce the complete logical information models that are developed in this
thesis. Relational database tables and processes are developed and presented to support
the capture, storage and management of systems engineering program data. Open-
source, freely-available computing components were used in the development of this
thesis.
