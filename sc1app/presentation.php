    <p>Electrification of transportation in Washington State is the current focus topic.  Transportation transition to electric
    power is a very interesting social-technical problem.  The solution to this problem has many benefits and important 
    considerations for the residents of Washington State.</p>
      
      <p>Two of the primary benefits of transitioning from petroleum based fuel to electricity for transportation are
      the utilization of electric power produced in Washington State and the reduction of Washington State resources 
      allocated to the purchase of foreign oil products.</p>  
      
      <p>The design, evaluation, production and operation of an electric powered transportation system in Washington
      State will create new high technology jobs, demonstrate leadership in large scale transportation system integration,
      and spur economic development.  The scale of electric transportation system range from individual homeowners who
      have photovoltaic solar panel electric energy production and an electric vehicle, to electric trolly fleets that are 
      powered by the main primary power grid.  Test scale versions of electric transportation infrastructure are being installed
      in Washington State at this time.  More information is available at: <a href="http://www.electricdrive.wa.gov/">Electric Drive</a></p>
      
      <p>Other online resources that address the transition from oil based fuel to electric transportation power 
      can be found at: <a href="http://better-energy-llc.com">Better-Energy-LLC</a>  An independent electric transportation report 
      was prepared and delivered to a Washington State Senate member in December of 2011.  This report determined that electrification 
      of transportation and distributed solar panel generation of electricity can:<br/>
      ----  Assure state energy independence<br/>
      ----  Generate local clean energy jobs<br/>
      ----  Support low cost transportation<br/>
      ----  Eliminate the largest of fossil fuel in Washington State<br/>
      ----  Support wind power load matching<br/>
      ----  Create distributed generation on grid<br/>
      ----  Provide large-scale climate relief<br/>
